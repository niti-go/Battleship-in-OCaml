val valid_mult_answer : int -> int -> int -> bool
(** [valid_mult_answer input num1 num2] checks if the input matches the
    multiplication result of [num1] and [num2]. *)

val multiplication_game : int -> int -> bool
(** [multiplication_game] simulates a minigame for the player to solve a
    multiplication problem involving user interaction, and returns true if the

(** [three_tries] lets the user have three guesses for the anagram game. *)

val anagram_game : unit -> bool
(** [anagram_game] simulates a minigame for the player to guess a word given the
    scrambled version. *)

val play_mini_game : t -> bool
(**[play_mini_game player] plays a minigame, if the [player]'s minigame option
   is set to true, and returns whether or not [player] wins the minigame.*)
